Riccardo Pinosio is currently Senior Data Scientist at Altius (Avanade) and lecturer in Machine
Learning at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. His main interests are:

- Data strategy and digital transformation consulting
- Machine learning (especially forecasting and optimization, asset pricing, marketing intelligence,
  information retrieval and natural language, IoT)
- Bayesian models and statistical inference
- Machine learning engineering and MLOps
- Models that combine neural networks and formal methods (e.g. logic and semantic technologies)
- Open source software

He pursues these interests from both an applied and theoretical standpoint, since
the cross-pollination between academia and industry is the ultimate driver of
technological innovation, value creation and competitive advantage.
